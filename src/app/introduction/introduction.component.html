        Hello! I'm Sam, and I have been working in front-end development for the last 2 years, but programming for the last 7.
        I started off as an analyst where my love for coding grew, but my love for analytics eventually died. Towards the end of my
        analyst career, I started dabbling in some front-end work using native javaScript and found a new calling in life.
        <br>
        <br>
        I thoroughly enjoy the problem solving aspects in the field, and creating the best UX for the application I'm working on. 
        I'm no stranger to data visualisation either - not all that time as an analyst was wasted!
