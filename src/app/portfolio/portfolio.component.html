    <p class="color__white">Hearthstone is an online card game which I have a love/hate (mostly hate) relationship with. 
    People describe it as a cross between poker and chess, but I'm quite bitter about it and think it's mostly a
    random number generator in card form.

    <p class="color__white">From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone" class="color__orange">Wikipedia</a> - <em>The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, 
        using constructed decks of 30 cards along with a selected hero with a unique power. 
        Players use their limited mana crystals to play abilities or summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal of reducing the opponent's health to zero.</em>
